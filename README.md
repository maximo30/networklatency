#Simple network health check
Health checks internet connection:
A jupyter notebook for graphing network latency and how often your network fails to deliver a package. If you like to collect
your own data as much as I do, you may like to check your ping requests just for the sake of curiosity. A simple Bash script
to create a CVS file with the ping data.
